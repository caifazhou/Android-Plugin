# Navisens/Android-Plugin/Repositories

This branch contains all of the repositories to be imported with maven.

To include a plugin with our MotionDna SDK, make sure to set up the Android SDK as usual, then add plugins afterwards.

See the [master branch](https://github.com/navisens/Android-Plugin/) for full documentation on including plugins.
